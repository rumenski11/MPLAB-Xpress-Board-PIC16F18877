## About DM164142
 This [MPLAB Xpress board](https://store.comet.bg/download-file.php?id=16782) makes use of the PIC16F18877 MCU. Coming from a product family that showcases a 10-bit ADC with Computation (ADC2) for automated signal analysis, this MCU is perfect for helping to reduce system complexity. In addition to the Core Independent Peripherals, various communication interfaces, CRC/SCAN, Hardware Limit Timer (HLT) and Windowed WDT (WWDT) this device supports customers looking to add safety and system monitoring to their application. This MCU also features power conserving functionality, including Idle/Doze operating modes, Peripheral Module Disable (PMD) and eXtreme Low-Power (XLP) technology for a wide range of possible applications..

Programming the MPLAB Xpress PIC16F18877 Evaluation Board is quick and easy, because of the unique drag-and-drop programmer which is compatible with almost any USB-connected PC, laptop, or tablet. The MPLAB Xpress Evaluation board connects to your PC as a USB Flash drive, so no drivers are needed. Programming of the target device is completed in microseconds, with no waiting.
